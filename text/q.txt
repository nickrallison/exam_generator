Text: Figure 21-11 shows four situations in which five charged particles are evenly spaced along an axis. The charge values are indicated except for the central particle, which has the same charge in all four situations. Rank the situations according to the magnitude of the net electrostatic force on the central particle, greatest first.

Text: Figure 21-12 shows three pairs of identical spheres that are to be touched together and then separated. The initial charges on them are indicated. Rank the pairs according to (a) the magnitude of the charge transferred during touching and (b)  the charge left on the positively charged sphere, greatest first.
